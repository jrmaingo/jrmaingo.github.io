jet-lag sucks, imagine if we could fly planes fast enough that the time zone appears to be the same in the origin and destination. This would require travelling at speeds that are close to the speed of light

Some background on [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#Simple_inference_of_velocity_time_dilation)

<div>
\begin{align}
    \Delta t' &= \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\end{align}
</div>

Since we're flying between two points on the Earth, we'll treat them as stationary relative to our imaginary passenger. The locations will perceive a greater passage of time since the plane will be moving faster and therefore passengers on the plane will perceive a lesser passage of time.

## Assumptions
* We're going to be thinking in terms of forward passage of time only, so there will be no consideration for negative intervals of time.
* We're going to assume that the plane can travel at arbitrarily fast speed and can transition from full speed to stopped instantly

## Variables

<div>
    \begin{align*}
        t_{flight} &= \text{time for passengers on the flight} \\
        t_{origin} &= \text{time for observer on the ground at origin} \\
        t_{dest} &= \text{time for observer on the ground at destination} \\
        \Delta{d} &= \text{distance covered by flight} \\
        \Delta{z} &= \text{time zone difference between origin and destination}
    \end{align*}
</div>

We have
<div>
    \begin{align*}
        &t_{flight} = t_{origin} \\
        &t_{origin} + \Delta{z} = t_{dest} \\
        &t_{origin}' + \Delta{z} = t_{dest}' \\
        &\Delta t_{origin} = \Delta t_{dest}
    \end{align*}
</div>
We want solve for
<div>
    \begin{equation*}
        t_{flight}' = t_{dest}'
    \end{equation*}
</div>
